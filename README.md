## :inbox_tray: Installation

Clone the repository in your Home directory :

### For "epload" script :

Add the execution right to the installation file :

$ chmod +x epload
```

Finally, add alias :
```sh
$ echo "alias epload='~/epload'" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
or

```


## :rocket: Launch

After installation, you can now launch from anywhere by typing :
